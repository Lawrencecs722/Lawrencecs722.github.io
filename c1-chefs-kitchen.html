  <h1>I Walked Into a Restaurant and Found a Kitchen</h1>
  <h2>My Paradigm Shift from Restaurant Patron to Chef</h2>
  <h4>Sunday, May 3rd, 2015</h4>

    Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?

	</p>
    <p>
    This is going to be one challenging course.

    </p>
    <p>
    In traditional schooling, students get a syllabus, a specific set of resources, daily exercises that need to be validated, periodic testing, all of which is structured by the instructor.  DBC offers analogs to all these things, but there’s a great deal of self-direction involved.

    </p>
    <p>
    This wasn’t what I was initially expecting, but over the course of my life, self-taught is how I learned some of the more potent skills in my arsenal.  I’m actually looking forward to the paradigm shift.


    </p>
    <p>
    What is your impression of DBC?

    </p>
    <p>
    My initial impression of DBC is it’s a crucible.  And like a crucible, DBC provides great intensity and a lot of energy and if used properly could render out a lot of great things. How much useful material comes out of a crucible is largely dependent on the investment, and that will mean all of me.


    </p>
    <p>
    How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

    </p>
    <p>
    I’ll be interacting more like an adult in a sharing collaboration, rather than feeling like a child whose hand is being held.  I’ll be comfortable leaning on my experience and the experience of others in addition to traditional resources.


    </p>
    <p>
    Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?

    </p>
    <p>
    Yes.  Rather than feeling like I have something to prove (to a teacher), I now feel more like I have something to share.  I’m no longer expecting my instructors to hand-hold me. I will be my own leader, and look forward to learning from the leadership of others.

    <p>
    Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?
    </p>
    <p>
    Absolutely.

    </p>
    <p>
    Does it make you nervous?

    <p>Absolutely.

    </p>
    <p>
    Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.

    </p>
    <p>
    I’ll be curios to learn the reasoning behind this video being presented a week into the curriculum rather than before the admissions process begins. As I was watching it, I found myself thinking that it’s probably a good thing I didn’t see it beforehand as I wouldn’t have known that I was capable of doing exactly what it said and may never have applied to the school.
