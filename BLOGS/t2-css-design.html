<p>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</p>

<img src="/imgs/image.png"/>

<p>In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) a given tag may create an object you will see in your website.  There is spacing and borders that are relevant to that object:</p>
<p>Content: That's the big of info the tag is all about. And it is around this object that margins, borders and padding will go.</p>
<p>Margin:  This is the area that is between the border and all the other stuff on the same website.  </p>
<p>Border: This is the hard line that truly separates an element from all other elements on a website.</p>
<p>Padding:  This is the area between the content itself  and the border of the object.<br>The more padding there is, the further the border will be from the content.</p>



<p>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</p>
<p>In general.... If you look to set up a style that  apply to several objects on your website,<br> say the same border on multiple "frames" or the same font-style in a handful of sections,<br> use of the class selector would be a better choice. But, if you're looking to give a certain <br>look to just one thing on the website, an ID is a better choice.</p>

<p>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</p>
<p>Positioning of an object is always in relation to something else. Even if there is only one<br> object in your website, it will still move in reference to the site.  How objects move in<br> relation to each other depends on positioning.</p>

<p>Relative positioning:  Set this way, an object would move relative to wherever it was initially placed.</p>
<p>Absolute positioning: An object set this way would sort of follow the lead of another object.<br>  Say you have some text in a block.  The block is set to stay in one spot.  The text (set<br> with "position:absolute;") would stay however you told it to relative to that block.</p>

<p>Fixed positioning: In this case, an object anchors itself to wherever you tell it, regardless<br> of what any other objects are doing, and regardless of how you scroll.</p>


<p>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</p>
<p>When you have multiple blocks that have different dimensions and you want them to line up you<br> can set them to display: inline-block or just display:inline. The former will actually<br> retain the formatting for each of your blocks such that they line up one next to the other.<br>  Displaying inline would put the same blocks side by side also, but would not retain any of that<br> formatting.</p>
