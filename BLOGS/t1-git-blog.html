      ** What is version control?  **
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's begin by going over some of the attributes of Version Control.
    </p>
    <p>
      * Version Control keeps track of the changes you make to a file.
      * Version Control creates a kind of save-point to which you can go back if you later discover an error.
      * Version Control allows multiple contributors to add to a file such that one person's work won't clobber another's.
      * Version Control Records: 
                                What file that was changed.
                                Who made a change.
                                When a change was made.
                                What label was used to describe the change.
                                Any background information on why the change was made.
                                What was deleted.
                                What was added.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those attributes describe what is done when the process of Version Control is used but what, exactly, is it? Why would anyone use it? HOW would it be used? And who would be interested in making use of this handy tool?
    </p>
    <p>
      In basic terms, Version Control is a way of maintaining data that allows that data to be improved upon. It also saves work at whatever point the contributor (that would be you) designates. A copy is made of that saved data so the user can improve the copy. If the copy doesn't quite work out, it can be scrapped and another one started from the saved copy. And if lots of people contribute to the same data, Version Control can prevent one person's work from being overwritten by another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's think of this in terms of writing a book. You just completed five chapters in your Zombie/Vampire, period space odyssey, love story and saved a copy. You intend to continue writing the book but have decided to share authorship with 2 other people because one of them has a vivid and detailed imagination, and the other knows a lot of technical details about... well, everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of you makes a copy of what you've save so far; yes even you get just a copy. You continue writing forward from where you left off, while the others go back through what you've done so far. The imagination person makes changes here and there.The technical person does the same. In a few spots, they BOTH make changes to the same passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control would allow each contributor to compare their contributions with everyone else's. If you're all playing nice, you coordinate which improvements stay, and which ones go. Because the original work done is saved separate from the active work being done, if you all lose your copies you still have the original to 
      work with.

      ** How Does Git Track Changes? **
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe we start with what "Git" is first, okay? s'Okay! s'Allright. Git is an open source Version Control system. It is a program capable of doing all the nifty stuff discussed in the paragraphs above. Short 'n sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it actually tracks changes is by creating branches off of the main body of work for collaborators to work on. Think of it like a tree.  The project everyone's working on can be thought of as the trunk. When someone works on it, Git creates a branch off that main trunk for them to work on. If the changes made work out, they can be merged back into the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As described in the first article above, Git is capable of documenting who made changes, when they were made, what exact changes were made and any notations collaborators made describing the background for why those changes were made. This documentation occurs for each change that was made, making those changes easier to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, say there was a function in the coding that allowed a user launch an email program and populate the "to" field with a specific email address. A change was made to that coding to specify a different email address.  The documentation provided by Git ends up revealing that the email address was changed because the person to whom the old address belonged no longer works for the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years later the people using the new email address suddenly need historical emails from before this change, but they forgot what email was used.  Through Git, one could go to the point in time the change was made and compare the coding before and after the change. Viola! You are able to see notations telling you what email address was used prior to the change!
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, it's not finding big-foot, or a closet full of Louis Vuitton but trust me, THIS IS COOL STUFF!

      ** Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code **
    </p>
    <p>
         Git - A Version Control program that sits resident in an individual's computer.
      GitHub - A version Control program that resides on the web as a hub where contributors pull and push data.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're collaborating using only Git, each person who contributes has a copy of Git on their computer. Pushes and pulls are made from one computer to another computer. That's all well and good if there are only two, three, maybe even five contributors working on the same project. But when you start climbing toward a hundred contributors, it becomes super inefficient.  Ever play keep-away or hot-potato with a hundred people? I can't tell you how fun that is.  Really. I can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fun detail; because Git is resident on your computer, you can't really access the project you're working on unless you're on THAT computer.  There's no opportunity for you to work on it anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since we're talking non-local residency... Let's say the program you're using for day-to-day is copied to  GitHub also.  Your server room is suddenly besieged by howler monkeys with Big-Gulps. System down.  But once the servers are replaced
      (howler monkeys... Big Gulps...), the program you saved to GitHub can be imported and brought back online.  Nifty, huh?
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub does all the Version Control magic I discuss in the previous entries above, but where it shines is it's ability to handle a HUGE number of contributors working on the same project and still maintain the integrity of the project. And because it's non local hub, ALL of those contributors can work on their parts of the project from any computer that has appropriate internet access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, GitHub has a host of options that allow the project being worked on to be accessible to everyone, or just you, or just people you designate. What's more, there's even functionality that allows you to control what is contributed to your work by those people who are allowed to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trusting the the internet with something so precious as your hard work may seem scary, but there is sufficent  safeguard built into it such that the awesomeness that is GitHub is even more AWESOME.
