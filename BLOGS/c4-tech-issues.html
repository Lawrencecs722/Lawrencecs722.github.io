  “A few months ago a long-standing colleague of mine decided to leave her tech company after 14 years. The pay was good, benefits great, but she came to the realization that she couldn’t breach that proverbial ‘glass ceiling.’ Despite her stellarqualifications, she resigned.”

  So begins an article posted by Neal Leavitt on February 25th, 2015.  The article goes on to quote contributors from a Los Angeles times reporter, to a fellow (an associate, not a dude) with Stanford University, a professor UC Hastings College of the Law, and several others all of whom gave perspective on the subject of gender disparity in the Technology sector.

  <p>
  I hesitate to quote the exact statistics outlined in the article because tracking down the studies these people are discussing proved to be impractical for this blog posting. I will leave it for you to see the article for yourself if you would like to chase those rabbits down their respective holes.  So for the purposes of this entry, I’ll try to avoid quotes and statistics.

  I’ve worked most of my life in retail and customer service where the presence of women in leadership positions down to entry level is common place. As a guy, my work-related joys and concerns interacting with female co-workers were the same in working with male counterparts. Having a great boss wasn’t gender specific and my respect (won or lost) didn’t depend on whether you were a man or woman (there are jerks in both genders). The same was true for co-workers I shared rank with, and subordinates I watched over.  
  </p><br>
  <p>
I mention this previous experience because it’s hard for me to relate to the information I read in this article.  I understand it intellectually, but to this day (and I’m in my 40s) do not comprehend why a woman should be paid any less than her male counterpart, or receive disparaging treatment that man would not. This isn’t feminist training or specific sensitivity; at my core I just don’t believe it’s right to do.
  </p><br>
  <p>
The article goes on to state that the Technologies sector is increasingly dominated by men and not for lack of interest on the part of women. One of Leavitt’s citations from Catalyst, a nonprofit research organization focused on the advancement of women says that given the same number of MBA graduates men and women, 53% of female MBAs left tech intensive professions as compared to 31% of men. This citation pointed to the culture of the sector colloquially called “brogrammer” was a contributing factor.
  </p><br>
  <p>
  Brogrammer culture.  Okay, the long and short of it is Brogrammer Culture is a good-ole-boys club.  Nobody in the article claimed it was a universal truth throughout the industry, but I got the impression everyone thought it was a ubiquitous phenomenon.  I got that impression from another <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/21/tech-sector-sexist-survey-guardian">article</a> Leavitt cites 600 IT professionals were polled on the subject and gave their frank assessments.  These are folks that work in the industry who gave their view based on personal experience and observations. 
  </p><br>
  <p>
  From their experience the culture being toxic to women seems to manifest in things like being passed up for promotion, not being advanced to a significant position of leadership (think VP or Chief-Executive), not having original ideas heard, not being recognized for exceeding production goals and increasing ROI (return on investment).  Personally, I’m not one to stay where I’m not appreciated, but how much worse must it feel to know that you are worth more than the co-worker next to you who’s only obvious difference from you is a single chromosome? I imagine these kinds of behaviors have driven countless women out of the field.
  </p><br>
  <p>
  More is the pity because with that loss comes the loss of innovation and advancement the field (and indeed our species) might otherwise have enjoyed.  According to Vivek Wadhwa, that Stanford Fellow I mentioned earlier, startups by women “achieve 35% higher return on investment, and, when venture-backed, bring in 12% higher revenue than venture-backed male-owned tech companies.”  We are figuratively passing up pure gold and flawless gems because some guy can’t see the value of a woman contributing. I daresay we’d be a lot further along in this game if we all would leave gender out of it.
  </p><br>
  <p>
  I leave the advancement of women to them; they know best how to approach the issue.  But I do admonish all men to ditch the pride and arrogance in believing a shallow difference amounts to superiority. IT should have no gender.

  IT shouldn’t have a gender, just my opinion. But what do we do about making that a living reality? 
  </p><br>

  “If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him.  We need not wait to see what others do.” – Ghandi 
  </p><br>
  <p>
  Those are the actual words Ghandi spoke which may have led to the less gender biased, “You must be the change you wish to see in the world”, which, apparently, nobody ever actually heard him say.
  </p><br>
  <p>
  If real, beneficial and healing change is to occur, we must all of us start behaving by a new standard.  When I finally get my job in IT, I will evaluate the worth of a co-worker based on their productivity, their innovation, how much my company is enriched by their presence and how much everyone around that person is enriched. Based on that I will promote them, if only by holding them up in front of others, but also if I am empowered to raise them up professionally. I will document what my criteria are and share that set of criteria with the world, hoping it will be embraced and improved by the world.
  </p><br>
  <p>
  After that… maybe start encouraging the establishment of social media campaigns to begin recognizing companies that innovate in the cultural change in IT.  Start networking with like-minded people who promote the companies and individuals who contribute both to technology and to the advancement of a gender-blind, color-blind IT community.  You know, something small to start.  </p><br>
  <p> 
  That’s it for now.  Be safe and live well.
